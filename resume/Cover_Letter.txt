Dear [Hiring Manager Name],

I’m writing to express my interest in the [Role] at [Company]. As a Backend & Mobile Developer with 2+ years of experience building Spring Boot backends and Android/Flutter applications, I bring practical experience in designing RESTful APIs, optimizing PostgreSQL queries, and delivering reliable mobile experiences with Firebase integration. At Xmplar Management Solutions I contributed to backend features that improved system stability and collaborated closely with mobile teams to ship integrated releases.

I enjoy solving performance and reliability problems and documenting learnings to improve engineering practices. I’d welcome the opportunity to bring hands-on backend and mobile experience to [Company], and to help deliver performant, user-centered products. Thank you for considering my application — I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute.

Sincerely,
